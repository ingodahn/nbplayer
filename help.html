<h1 id="read-me">Notebook Player</h1>
<p>Notebook-Player is a tool to convert Jupyter notebooks into dynamic HTML pages using SageCell.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Make the required player settings for the web page to be generated and load the Jupyter notebook file.</p>
<p>Create the intended view and save the file.</p>
<h2 id="input-and-output-cells">Input and Output Cells</h2>
<p>Input and output cell make it possible to transfer data from one notebook player document to another.</p>
<h3 id="output-cells">Output Cells</h3>
<p>Output cells have a markdown cell, giving some explanations, and a code cell printing the commands to instantiate key variables with their current values. Note that only literal values, no objects or plots, can be saved.</p>
<p>Output markdown cells must have a node of the form <code>&lt;span class=&quot;nbdataOut&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> This node may contain a node <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code> with child nodes <code>&lt;li class=&quot;successor&quot;&gt;&lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code> where the <code>&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> node links to a notebook with an input cell using these variables.</p>
<h3 id="input-cells">Input Cells</h3>
<p>Input cells have a markdown cell, giving some explanations, and a code cell executing the commands to instantiate key variables with specific values.</p>
<p>Input markdown cells must contain a node <code>&lt;span class=&quot;nbdataIn&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 class="expertMode">Collapsing and Expanding Sections</h2>
<p>To support Expanding/Collapsing of sections, call the Notebook Player page with parameter level=expert.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Select Expanding/Collapsing of Sections only if your notebook has aside of all h3 nodes metadata of the following form</p>
<p><code>&lt;span class=&quot;mathtrek&quot; mtin=&quot;,-separated list of operators and variables that must be defined before code cells are executed&quot; mtout=&quot;,-separated list of operators and variables that will be defined after code cells are executed&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>A stylesheet <code>custom.css</code> in the same directory as the output html file can be used to style the output.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<p>After saving the resulting html view, the page in the player is no longer functional. In order to generate an alternative view, the page must be reloaded.</p>
